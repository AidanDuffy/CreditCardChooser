# CreditCardChooser
## Basic Overview

This is a basic program that I am desgined during my Python information structures course while pursuing my Master's degree at Boston University. It is essentially a digital wallet which stores generic wallet information for a user and helps that user decide which credit cards to use to maximize their benefits, rewards, and/or cash back on their spending.

## Problem

Almost everyone uses credit cards in their daily life, almost all of which offer some kind of category spending benefits, ie one card may offer extra cash back on groceries and another on gas. Additionally, many cards offer incredible sign up bonuses usually ranging from $200-$1500. While lots of folks enjoy researching many cards and grinding for rewards, most people do not have the time nor inclination to do so. This program helps users maximize their benefits while doing little to no research!

## Solution

This program will takes in the user's cards and when they are purchasing food, travel arrangements, gas, or anything else, it will help them decide which card to use in order to maximize their returns.

## Future Additions

I would like to eventually add a GUI for the program and perhaps even port it to an iPhone or Android application so it is available outside of a command line.
