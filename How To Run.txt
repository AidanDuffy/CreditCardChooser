Final Project

How to Run the Program:

First, please ensure you have an empty "user cards.txt" as well as the fully
populated "Credit Card Database.txt" file. From here, please run the main
method the main.py file. The project has a number of subroutines, so please add
a card or two to your wallet, then feel free to try any of the other options
from the main menu. Any time you want to start over (for instance, if you want
to try something with a card that has an active sign up bonus vs when it is
deactivated) just remove everything from the user cards file. This populates the
user's wallet everytime the program runs. A few things to note: when entering in
a card issuer, please make sure case and spelling matches the database. For
instance, I used "AMEX" instead of "American Express". Also, any time a function
asks for an input to be done Issuer,Card Name, please ensure you do not use a
space after the comma for proper functionality(the program will handle the error
but it just won't give you your desired output). Further, when it asks for a Y/N
please just input those letters with that case. I plan to add y,n, yes,no, etc.
as options in the future -- along with spaces after commas -- in the future.
Finally, anytime you enter 0 on the main menu, please ensure your user card text
file has been populated with accurate information that you provided while
running the program. Ultimately, I tried to make most of the entry pretty
intuitive for the user, but if you find anything beyond errors, such as any
confusing behavior, please include in the report as I would love to fix it!
Thanks again for this really cool opportunity, and I hope you enjoy the program.
